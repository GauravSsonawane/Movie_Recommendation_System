## End to End ML project
I developed a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System to suggest similar movies based on features like genres, cast, crew, keywords, and movie overview. The dataset was preprocessed by combining these features into a single tags column, which was then normalized (lowercased and stemmed) to reduce words to their root forms. Using CountVectorizer, the text data was converted into numerical vectors with a vocabulary size of 5000, excluding stop words. Cosine similarity was applied to compute pairwise similarities between movies. A recommendation function was built to rank and suggest the top 5 most similar movies for a given title. The system was finalized by saving the processed data and similarity matrix into .pkl files for deployment. This project enhanced my understanding of NLP techniques, content-based filtering, and building scalable recommendation systems.
